# Techincal takehome for P. B.

## Getting Started

This repository includes the simulations for the Data Scientist technical problems. These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine

The notebook used to help solve the problems is `fermsim.ipynb` 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Docker: [Installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose: [Installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/AKilbo/powtechnical.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd powtechnical
    ```

3. Run Docker Compose:
    ```
    docker compose up
    ```

Now, the jupoyter server should be running at `localhost:8888`. and the terminal should have the key to access the server.

Alternatively you can copy `fermsim.ipynb` into an already working environment
